# Day 2

In the mid-90s I spent a lot of time on Windows 95 (and later Windows 98). Being the clueless "1337 HAX0R" I thought I was, I dabbled in Batch scripting. I never accomplished much, but it still counts as programming, so I will attempt to use it for Day 2.

I don't have super-easy access to Windows on personal machines anymore, but purity is less-important to me on this compared to Day 01, so WINE will suffice.

## Prerequisites for Ubuntu 22.04

* WINE (from distro package manager): `sudo apt install wine`

More to come later
