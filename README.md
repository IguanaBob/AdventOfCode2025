# AdventOfCode2024
My solutions to the Advent of Code 2025, posted as I go.

I'm going to try to mix it up this year. I have some odd ideas, and if I can figure out how to implement them you will see them as I figure them out. Some may not be doable, but at the very least I want to have a veriaty of different languages.

Last year I waited until after the 25th to start posting my solutions, but really with LLMs and plenty of other solutions already posted online there is no point. If you are going to cheat, I can't stop you, that's on you and you alone.
