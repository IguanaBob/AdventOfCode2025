# Advent of Code 2025

My solutions to Advent of Code 2025, posted as I go.

I’m going to try something different this year. I have some odd ideas, and if I can figure out how to implement them, you’ll see them as I work through each day. Some may not be doable, but at the very least I want to have a variety of different languages.

Last year I waited until after the 25th to start posting my solutions, but honestly with LLMs and plenty of other solutions already online, there is no point in waiting. If you are going to cheat, I can’t stop you. That’s on you and you alone.

If I list the languages I learned in roughly chronological order, I believe it would go like this:

* [Day 01](Day01/): Apple BASIC (MAME/Apple IIe)
* [Day 02](Day02/): MS-DOS/Win9x Batch (DOS-Box-X)
* HTML/CSS/Javascript
* C++
* BASH
* Java
* PHP
* Python
* PowerShell
* Ansible/YAML/Jinja (possible?)
* ???

The order may not be perfect. This only includes languages I actually learned and used for more than a few minutes or hours. So things like Perl, Assembly, etc. don’t count. If I didn’t forget anything, that leaves one slot open to learn something new as well.
